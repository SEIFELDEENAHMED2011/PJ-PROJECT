        <h2>Prior to the British Mandate and the establishment of a Palestinian 
            currency, the situation with money in Palestine was quite mixed. 
            <br>
            There wasn't a single currency specific to the region. Here's what
             you'd find:
             <br>
            Ottoman Currency: As Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire for 
            centuries, the dominant currency was the 'Ottoman lira'. This
            <br>
             would have been the main form of exchange for most transactions.
            <br>
            Multi-Currency Mix:  Beyond the Ottoman lira, other 
            currencies circulated in Palestine. This could include 
            <br>
            currencies from neighboring Egypt (Egyptian pound) or even 
            European powers like Britain, France, and Russia. Trade with
            <br> 
            these countries would have brought their currencies into use.
            <br>
            So, before the occupation,
             Palestine lacked a single, unifying currency.
              It functioned with a mix of currencies depending 
              <br>
              on trade and the historical context. </h2>
