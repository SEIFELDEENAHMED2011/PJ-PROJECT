            the date:
            Studies indicate that human presence in Palestine dates back to the Paleolithic Age, where ancient peoples worked in agriculture to meet their food needs. In the Early Bronze Age, many advanced cities appeared on the land of Palestine, with the emergence of urban communities. The Canaanites established their civilization on this land, which was advanced in many fields.
<br>          
            With the beginning of the Iron Age, the Israelite tribes arrived in Palestine and began coexisting with the Canaanites. The country also witnessed periods of Roman rule, during which the Palestinian cities witnessed important developments. The Roman Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, which led to its spread in the region.
<br>    
            In the seventh century AD, Islam arrived in Palestine and spread among its inhabitants, and wars occurred between Muslims and the Romans. During the Umayyad era, interest in Palestine increased and Arab culture increased among the population.
<br>
            Palestine witnessed the Crusades in the eleventh century, but the Muslims, led by Saladin al-Ayyubi, were able to regain control of the Palestinian territories.
<br>  
            In the Ottoman era, Palestine became administratively affiliated with Damascus, and the situation remained stable until the late nineteenth century.
<br>
            In the 20th century, Zionist campaigns began to aim to control the Palestinian territories, which flourished with the issuance of the Balfour Declaration in 1917. After World War II, Jewish immigration to Palestine was encouraged, leading to the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
<br>
            Geographical terrain:
            The geographical terrain in Palestine is divided into four main regions:
<br>
            Coastal Plain: It extends along the Mediterranean Sea and includes important cities such as Haifa and Jaffa.
<br>
            Central Highlands: It starts from the Galilee in the north to the Negev in the south, and forms a chain of mountains.
<br>
            Al-Ghor: A low-lying area that includes the Jordan River and several valleys.
<br>
            Negev: It is located in the south and is considered a semi-desert area with low terrain.
<br>
            the climate:
            The climate of Palestine is characterized by a Mediterranean climate, with hot summers and cold, rainy winters. Temperatures vary between geographical regions, as mountainous areas are characterized by moderate temperatures, while temperatures rise in lowland areas such as the Jordan Valley.</h2>
