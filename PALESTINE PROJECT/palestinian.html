<h2><b>The Palestinian flag is an ancient national symbol that embodies the aspirations of the Palestinian
     people and their 
    ancient struggle. Each of its four colors has a deep meaning:</b>
<hr>
    1. Black: symbolizes mourning
     for the injustice that has been inflicted on the Palestinian people for decades, 
     and indicates the great sacrifices made 
     by the Palestinians in order to gain their freedom.
<br> 
    2. White: symbolizes the peace sought 
    by the Palestinian people, and indicates
     their desire for peaceful coexistence with all peoples.
<br>
    3. Green: symbolizes the green, 
    fertile lands of Palestine, and indicates 
    the Palestinian peopleâ€™s attachment to their
     land and history.
<br>
    4. Red: symbolizes the blood 
    of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the 
    homeland, and indicates the strength and determination of the Palestinian
     people and their insistence on victory.
<br>
    Therefore, the Palestinian flag is a symbol of Palestinian national
     unity, and a symbol of the just struggle
      of the Palestinian people for freedom and independence.
